A warm welcome to you!!!


'Restriction-site-finder' helps you find all restriction (with position) sites in your FASTA sequence and their respective Restriction enzymes.

Command Line Interface (CLI) is built, which gives you a seamless experience. 

Input: the path of your file that contains the FASTA sequence (e.g., D:\desktop\fasta.txt)
Output: position of the restriction site, cut site, restriction enzyme/s (e.g., Position: **, cut site: **, RE: [*, *])



Thank you for using 'Restriction-site-finder'...
